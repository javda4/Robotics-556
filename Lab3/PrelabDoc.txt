In this odometry lab, several key parameters are essential for accurate motion tracking. The initial and final speeds, v1 and v2, determine changes in velocity over time. Orientation shifts from θ1 to θ2 are crucial for tracking direction changes. Time (t) influences the total distance traveled but does not directly affect speed or direction. The wheel diameter is necessary for calculating the linear distance traveled per wheel rotation, while the wheel base (the distance between the left and right wheels) plays a significant role in turning calculations. Additionally, counts per revolution (CPR) from the wheel encoders allow for precise tracking of movement by converting encoder readings into distance and angular displacement. These parameters collectively contribute to accurate odometry calculations for determining position and orientation over time.
